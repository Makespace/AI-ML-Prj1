Where Does It Live ?
It lives to the right of the storage bench near where the Compressor, the Shop-VAC and the Bandsaw are.
Itâ€™s on a wheeled trolley and pulls out easily.  Lifting it onto the workbench needs two people, do not try lift it on your own
Use of extraction with the thicknesser is mandatory.  The 100mm extraction pipe is suspended over the workbench.
The Thicknesser Manual is on the wiki and linked off this course.
