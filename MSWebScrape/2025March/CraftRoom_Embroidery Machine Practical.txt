Practical Assessment


Preparation for the Practical
You are strongly encouraged to follow the “Embroidery with Inkscape” training at home and prepare a file in the .pes format.
If you can’t do this the trainer will load a pre-prepared file from the machine’s memory for you to embroider.
If you bring in a tee shirt you will embroider this design on your own shirt, otherwise scrap fabric will be provided.

What You Will Do in the Practical
Demonstrate threading top and bottom bobbins (the trainer will assist you if required).
Mounts fabric and underlay on frame, clip the frame to the machine.
Load a file from their own USB memory stick or machine memory
Override default thread selections for the correct colours.
Stitch the Makespace logo (optionally with the trainee’s name if they made a file).
