Planer/Thicknesser
Practical Assessment 

You will need to bring with you a rough sawn board to mill which must be between 20 and 70mm thick, 250 and 1500mm long and no more than 310mm wide.
We do not have stock of boards suitable for milling and it is best to do the training immediately before you need to use the machine for a project.
Ideally your board should have been stored at Makespace for at least a week to allow it to acclimatise
In the practical assessment you can ask any questions you may have from the training
The trainer will discuss with you the process to surface plane and thickness a board.
Practical Assessment Preparation

In the practical assessment you will show the trainer you can use the Planer/Thicknesser safely by:
Setting up the machine for surface planing
Surface planing one face of your board
Jointing one edge of the board square to the planed face
Reconfigure the machine for thicknessing
Thicknessing your board
Shutting down the machine and packing away
