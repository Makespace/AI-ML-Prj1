Lone
Working

Individuals are alone at work when they are on their own, they cannot be seen or heard by another person, they cannot expect a visit from another member for some time and/or where assistance is not readily available when needed. Therefore, lone workers are those who work by themselves without close or direct supervision. This includes when:

Only one person works on the premises
One person works separately from others
One person works outside normal hours

Members will avoid lone working wherever possible. Please do not work in the space (particularly alone) between 12am and 6am without contacting the Safety Officer. All projects will be assessed for what procedures are allowable for lone work.

Lone working

If you find that lone working is necessary, please take relevant and sensible precautions. 
Specifically, you must:Notify another person (e.g. partner, housemate, friend, BioMakespace Lab chat) of each out-of-hours visit to the BioMakespace and the expected time of return. 
Carry a mobile phone and be aware of the locations of the lab phones. 
On arrival make contact with anyone else on Level 1 of Bay 13 and notify them of your departure. 
Sign in via the building or Level 1 signing-in book with their name, time of arrival and phone number, and sign out on departure.
Note the University Security Control Centre number, which will be prominently displayed in the space.
Ensure familiarity with emergency procedures including evacuation in the event of fire and the location of first aid kits.
