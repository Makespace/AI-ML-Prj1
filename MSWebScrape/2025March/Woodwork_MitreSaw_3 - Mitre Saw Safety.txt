Mitre saw safety: Setup
Unplug machine before making adjustments to the saw.
Check to make sure the saw table and surrounding area is clean and free of debris. 
Particularly if cutting metal, make sure area is free of sawdust buildup.
No loose clothing, no ties, no lanyards, no gloves. Tie back long hair.
Plan your cut to minimize chances of kickback or offcuts being thrown by the blade. (Consider cutting with a handsaw if you cannot cut safely with the mitre saw.)
When cutting mitres or bevels, ensure fence is clear of the blade (Do a “test run” without power to check where the blade will pass.)
Check the correct blade is installed for your material.
Check dust bag is not full. Remove and empty bag if necessary.
Check that the overhead dust extractors are on, the remote controller lives in a pocket on the power sockets hanging over the workbench.


Overhead Dust Extraction
When doing anything which generates dust or chips, including any machine tool which requires chip extraction or hand sanding, the overhead dust extractors MUST be used.
This removes harmful dust from the air which would otherwise be breathed in by anyone in the secure workshop.
The remote controller for the overhead extractors lives in a pocket on the power sockets hanging over the workbench.
Press the ON/SPEED button once, check that both extractors start.
Remember to switch them off when you are finished.
If the sign on the extractors indicates that the filters need changing, please change them and update the sign. There is no one to do this for you except other members.

Mitre saw safety: Operation
Check that both mitre handle and bevel lever are tightened, locking machine in position.
Plug in machine.
Without lowering arm, press power trigger to check blade is rotating freely. (Any abnormal noise or wobbling?)
Stand with legs apart, close to the machine. Can use left or right hand to operate saw, free hand to stabilize workpiece. 
Keep hands away from cutting area. Use clamps when appropriate.
Wait for the blade to stop spinning before lifting it out of workpiece.
Unplug machine when done cutting.
Leave workspace clean & clear.
If the blade breaks or teeth come off, turn off the machine, make a notice informing others it is out of action and contact workshop@makespace.org


Ensure long pieces of timber are supported so they do not fall off table after being cut.
When cutting small offcuts, consider using a backer board to prevent offcuts from bouncing around and potentially being thrown by blade. (example video)
When cutting a small or irregularly shaped workpiece, use a jig to secure the piece. This will keep your fingers away from the blade and ensure the blade doesn’t throw loose pieces through the workshop. Consider using a handsaw if power mitre saw not necessary.

Use a safety jig to hold small or irregularly shaped workpieces
