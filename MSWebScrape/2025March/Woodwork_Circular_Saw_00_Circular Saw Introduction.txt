Circular Saw Induction Training
Introduction

Introduction
A circular saw is used to size wood in preparation for further finishing
It can be used to:
Cut large boards to size
Cut across the grain (cross cut)
Cut long the grain (rip cut)
It is best suited for cutting to rough size. It is not very accurate. The resulting cut surfaces will probably need finishing
