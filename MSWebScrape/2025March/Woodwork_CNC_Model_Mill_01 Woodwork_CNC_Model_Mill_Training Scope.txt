Training: What is expected of you
The Roland MDX 40 Model Mill is designed to be easy to use, and is an excellent introduction to CNC machining. However, it requires an understanding of milling principles and safety, as well as familiarity with several software packages and the hardware platform itself. 
You are expected to:
Have a project in mind BEFORE you start the training
READ this document, including ALL of the linked videos and documents, AND read the Model Mill page on the Makespace Wiki – expect to commit ~ 4 hours to this if you new to CNC machining
COMPLETE the online safety assessment BEFORE you book a live Induction session
BOOK a live Induction session at which you will:
Demonstrate basic knowledge learnt in 1) and 2) above – IF THE INSTRUCTOR FEELS YOU HAVEN’T , YOU WILL BE ASKED TO RETURN TO STAGE (1) ABOVE
Complete a practical induction to the Model Mill, including safety, machine set-up and simple 2D engraving
PRACTICE on the machine as soon as possible after you have finished the training – ideally within a week - expect to commit ~ 4 hours to this if you are new to CNC machining
