Safety 

Safety and sterile working
Biomakespace does not allow working with pathogens, reducing safety concerns to operator and environment. To keep the operator and environment safe and to keep your experiments free from contamination, there are a number of do’s and don’t’s when using a safety cabinet

Do not stack boxes or items on top of the cabinet as this will block the air flow
The laminar flow cabinets are designed to be used by 1 operator only at one time - multiple operators may break the air curtain and contaminate the materials
Complete a risk assessment of your experiment before you start working
Take out all your reagents, specimens and the biobin with contaminated waste. Discard of the biobin via normal autoclave route

The Biomakespace safety officer organises for the safety cabinet to be re-certified annually, ensuring that the cabinet is safe to use



Personal Protective Equipment
Long sleeved lab coat
gloves 
Tuck the labcoat sleeve into the clove to avoid contamination from skin flora. 


Tips on good aseptic technique
It's essential that proper aseptic techniques are followed 
Do not keep moving your hands in and out of the cabinet while working - make sure that all reagents and equipment and waste bins are in the cabinet 
keep the top over petri dishes or tissue culture plates
Work as far back into the cabinet as possible, not close to the window
always recap vials; work with one specimen at a time and recap before going on to the next 
discard empty tubes immediately in bio bin;  this will minimize contamination of your work


Working with cells in bio labs
The risk from any cell line should be considered in terms of the likelihood of contamination (by pathogens) and the ability of the cell line to support growth of the contaminant
Before bringing any cells into the labs, documentation that shows that they tested negative for bacteria(including mycoplasma) as well as fungi needs to be available to the biosafety officer
Only cell lines classified as Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1) are allowed and need to be sourced from established suppliers
Our general policy is that no primary cell cultures or human and primate cell lines can be used in the space.
However, exceptionally and following a detailed risk assessment, well characterised or authenticated finite or continuous cell lines of human or primate origin may be used when:
There is low risk of endogenous infection with a biological agent presenting no apparent harm to laboratory workers
The cell line (only cell line classified as BSL1) has been purchased from established suppliers  (e.g ECACC, Abcam, ATCC) and has been tested for the most serious pathogens and this has been documented
Approval is given by the Biological Safety Officer(s).


What specimens are allowed in the biosafety cabinet
You can work with:

Only cells and cell  lines classified as Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1), sourced from established suppliers and with documentation on pathogen testing (including mycoplasma) 
Plant cells
Blood, obtained from verified suppliers to UK schools and after approval of the Biological safety officer


You can not work with:

Urine samples
Blood samples 
Bacteria and yeast cells
Human and primate tissue
Human and primate cell lines of unknown/non commercial  source 
Any GMO and GMM not approved by the Biological Safety Officer

If in doubt, contact bio-committee@makespace.org to ask for advice


What to do in case of a biological spill -1
If the spill is contained to the work surface of the cabinet

Do not turn the cabinet off - any aerosols that have been generated by the spill need to be cleared through the hepa filter
Remove your gloves inside the cabinet as they may have become contaminated 
Check your lab coat sleeves for contamination and discard the lab coat if it's dirty 
Wash your hands and put on fresh pair of gloves and a new lab coat 
Cover the spill with a paper towel to soak up the spill. Remove the solid waste into a autoclave bag. Cover the surface with 5% (final concentration) CHEMGENE allow min 10 minutes contact time to inactivate organisms
Wipe surrounding exposed surface and equipment with 2% CHEMGENE, contact time will depend on the microorganism and the decontaminant

Continue on next slide

What to do in case of a biological spill -2
if there are any sharps such as broken flask, pick it up with a pair of forceps or another instrument and place it in the sharps bin 
Clean the surface and equipment with 70% ethanol afterwards
After cleaning up a spill discard your gloves and replace them with a new pair 
allow the cabinet blower to run purging the work zone for several minutes
be sure to autoclave all contaminated materials
Record the incident in the accident book (Maker lab) and notify bio-committee@makespace.org. Explain what the spill contained.
If the spill caused liquid to go into the air grills, do not clean that by yourself. More extensive decontamination is required. Keep the cabinet on, call +44 (0)1223 927175. The bio safety officer will carry out the additional cleaning.
Place a note (with date/time and reason) on the BSC that it should stay switched on but cannot be used. Notify the lab users in the lab chat channel.
