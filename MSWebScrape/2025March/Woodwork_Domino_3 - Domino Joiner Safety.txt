Domino Joiner safety: Operation
The workpiece MUST be clamped or held against a bench dog or other stop.
The faceplate of the machine MUST be pressed against the workpiece before starting and after stopping the machine.
The Festool extractor MUST be connected, powered on and set to AUTO BEFORE starting the cut, it will start when the Domino starts.
When plunging the machine you MUST use a steady smooth motion. Each plunge should take between 2 and 5 seconds to complete, plunging too rapidly wears the cutter and could cause it to break.
The machine MUST be stopped before removing it from the workpiece.

Hold the machine firmly in both hands, with your primary hand on the body of the machine so the power switch can be operated with your thumb, and your secondary hand on the handle on the fence.
Press firmly against the workpiece while plunging the cutter.
DO NOT allow the fingers of your secondary hand to fall below the fence.
When cutting into a tall but thin workpiece, fit the Base Support Bracket.
