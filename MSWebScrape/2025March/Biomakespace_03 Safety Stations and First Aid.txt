Safety
Stations & First Aid

Phones
Phones are available in all three of the BioMakespace rooms for making emergency calls. Please donâ€™t use these for personal calls.

Safety Stations
These are located in each room next to the doors and have:
Eye wash
First Aid Kit
Torch
Fire extinguisher
Fire blanket
Safety stations and phones

We do not have designated first aiders because due to the nature of the space they are unlikely to be present when an incident occurs. In office hours, contact Reception for a first aider at work.

For a minor incident (even a plaster)

Use first aid kit as needed.
Make a report in the accident book - which you can find behind the door in the Maker lab/workshop 
Email a quick note to bio-committee@makespace.org so we can restock.

All accidents MUST be reported to management@makespace.org, no matter how small.

Bear in mind any chemical or biological risks and get as much information as you can if chemicals are involved. MSDS and COSHH forms are in yellow folder on the back shelf of the Main biolab 


The Risk assessments are in a red folder on the back shelf of the Main biolab 
First aid (minor)

Emergency and major first aid

Make sure you are safe when approaching or treating an ill or injured person.
If you are trained or familiar with first aid, follow the latest guidelines for checking for response, breathing and emergency assistance.
Call 999 if applicable, they will guide you through
A&E is also immediately opposite if the person is able to walk.
Make a report in the accident book in the Maker Lab.
Email bio-committee@makespace.org 

All accidents MUST be reported to management@makespace.org, no matter how small.

Bear in mind any chemical or biological risks and get as much information as you can if chemicals are involved. MSDS and COSHH forms are in a marked safety data sheet yellow folder in the Main Lab.

First aid (major)

If in the labs, see the sign near each safety station for contact information.

In an emergency: call emergency services (as applicable) then +44 (0) 1223 927175. This will reach one of the Directors. We recommend using the lab phones if possible, as mobile signal is often poor in the lab.

Report anything that is dangerous, a near miss or an accident e.g. chemical spill, broken glass, or situation that looks alarming. 

If something needs to be done immediately, follow the emergency procedures (see policies and laminated summaries in the lab) and do feel empowered to step in and tell people to stop what they are doing. Email addresses for reporting:
bio-committee@makespace.org 
management@makespace.org  

If you have general safety questions, there is a #safety and #lab channel in the Biomakespace Chat.
The next slide contains useful contact details, which you may wish to add to your phone now.
