3) Simple 2D Cutting: SCOPE
Before you start:
Set up Model Mill as per Section 2 above
Watch the videos cited in the Resources slides below
2D Cutting Tasks:
Start “Vectric V-Carve Pro” & define work piece
Draw a simple 2D shape in draw view
Switch to toolpath view
Define tool, select tool feeds & speeds appropriate to material being cut
Generate toolpath and review in software
Output toolpath to Model Mill for cutting



3) Simple 2D Cutting : Resources 1
Read the PDF “MDX 40A SET UP GUIDE” on the Makespace website
This is a Makespace-specific guide to setup of the Model Mill
Vectric Manual for V-Carve Pro is available at:

3) After Cutting : CLEAN UP
Continuous Maintenance – After every job, you must:
Clean the mill with a 1" paint brush, remove as much dust from the spindle area as possible before vacuuming. 
Vacuum the inside of the mill chamber. Do not blow the dust, it goes everywhere! 
Clean any debris off bed and surround using soft brush  and vacuum cleaner

The machine should look like this after use!
