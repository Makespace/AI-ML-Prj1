Consumables
The Easy Wood Tools bits and sandpaper provided are consumables. If the bits break / become dull, do not worry.  They can be rotated to expose a fresh edge, or replaced when all edges are worn. If you do this, please inform workshop@makespace.org, so we can purchase replacements. If sandpaper is worn out, replace it from the tray below the lathe.
If something on the lathe breaks, or something appears unsafe stop working immediately and inform workshop@makespace.org and it will be fixed. Do not attempt to repair it yourself.
Enjoy using the lathe!
