SECTION 1: MDX 40 Model Mill Safety

Personal Protective Equipment
Eye protection and hearing protection are optional. A dust mask is recommended for irritating dust e.g. MDF
Clothing, Hair and Jewellery
Remove dangling clothing and jewellery. Tie back long hair
Be careful fitting and removing milling bits
The edges of milling bits are very sharp (cut hazard)
After milling operations, the milling bit may be very hot (burn hazard)
NEVER leave the Model Mill running unattended
You must ALWAYS be within reach of the emergency cut-off button while it is running
If you need a bathroom break, you can pause the operation (“View” button) for a short period
1) MDX 40 Model Mill Safety

NEVER put your hand inside the chamber when it is operating
Manually-controlled spindle head movements are required for alignment, and are possible with the front cover raised
For manual spindle head movement, ENSURE no part of your body is inside the milling machine chamber – PINCH & CUT HAZARD
In an emergency, hit the big red Emergency Stop Switch
This immediately shuts down the machine, and deletes the cutting job
1) MDX 40 Model Mill Safety

You can mill all types of wood and man-made boards and soft plastics and foams. 
DO NOT cut metal, glass or ceramics
Take care to match milling bits with collets
We have 3,4,5 and 6mm collets, as well as 1/8” and ¼” collets
Ensure the shank of the milling bit matches the collet – measure if in doubt
Failure to do this will break the collet
Only remove one collet at a time – it is easy to mix them up
Take care to match Feeds and Speeds to Material
Selecting the wrong feed rate and spindle speeds for the milling bit and material being cut can cause poor cutting performance, excessive tool wear or in the worst case tool fracture
