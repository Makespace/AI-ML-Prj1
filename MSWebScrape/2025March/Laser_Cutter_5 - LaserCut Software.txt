LaserCut 5.3

LaserCut 5.3
To control the laser cutter, we use LaserCut 5.3
This is proprietary software which requires a license USB dongle to run
There are license dongles plugged in to both laser cutter computers - do not remove them
Makespace has two licenses, one for each laser cutter computer
Please do not use the laser cutter computers for anything other than laser cutting, as you prevent others from using the software
Nottinghack have a download which can be used in “demo mode” 
It is lacking “Save”/“Open” functionality, but can help you become familiar with the software.

Import and Configuration Process

Overview of Process
Draw, or import a design (e.g. a .dxf file)
Unite Lines to convert separate line segments into continuous shapes
Confirm size/scale
Configure cut settings:
Engrave vs. cut vs. perforate
Speed and power
Simulate to sanity check
Download to laser cutter
Repeat as needed

LaserCut project in 5 minutes (no sound)
Draw, or import
Unite Lines

Speed and power
Simulate to sanity check
Download to laser cutter
Repeat as needed

Draw or import a design
LaserCut’s native drawing ability is rudimentary at best
It’s better to draw your designs in another package, and import to LaserCut
This also means you aren’t tying up a laser cutter computer
Import file(s) via “File”->“Import”
“Open” is for previously saved LaserCut files. “Import” is for .dxf / .ai etc.


2. Unite lines
Imported drawings often get split into lots of line segments
The laser will cut each in a random direction - which is inefficient and may be imprecise
They need to be combined into a closed shape to allow engraving
Under “Tools” is a “Unite Lines” option
This joins together lines which start/end near to each other
Select lines with the mouse, then pick “Tools” -> “Unite Lines”
After import, all lines from that file will be selected - this is a convenient time to “Unite Lines”
3 separate lines
1 single closed shape

3. Confirm size / scale
Distance units in LaserCut 5.3 are millimetres
.dxf is a dimensionless format - 1 unit may be 1 mm, 1 pixel, 1 parsec
It depends on your CAD software - in Inkscape set “Base Unit” to “mm” when saving
Check the size of your design after importing
Select shape(s), and click the “Size” button
You can set both dimensions explicitly
OR, you can set one dimension and click “...” next to the otherto scale it proportionally
Size

4. Configure cut settings
LaserCut works in layers. Each layer is a different colour
Each layer can have different laser settings
Layers are cut in order, top->bottom in the layer list
To assign a layer, select shape(s) and then click a colour
Re-order layers with the “Up” and “Down” buttons below thelayer list
Configure cut settings in the layer list:
Drop-down to the right of the colour sets Cut vs Engrave
Double click the colour block to set the speed + power
Color (layer) selection

Don’t use these controls

5. Simulate, check run time
You can simulate your design to visualise the tool path
Simulation speed is configurable
The time estimate button indicates how long the job will take
You can save an .ecp project to keep your layers + settings
“File”->“Save as” - To a USB stick please! Don’t leave clutter on the laser cutter computers

6. Download
Turn on the laser cutter by turning the key
Wait for it to boot completely (watch the screen)
Click the “DownLoad” button in LaserCut
Click “Del All”
Click “Download Current”
Assuming all is well, you are now done with the PC

Drawing Details

“Pick” tool
The “pick” tool switches back to a normal mouse cursor
Shift + J
You need to be in “pick” mode to select, move, etc.

Simple Shapes
Draw approximately and then resize with the size tool
Lines can be joined together
Look for the symbol when clicking near the end of a line
Polylines are automatically united
Separate lines need to be united manually

Text
Text can be added, click the icon and drag a box
Select another shape first to place along a path

Aligning Shapes
Shift + Click to select multiple shapes
Align with the alignment tools
Shapes will align to the last selected

Offset Curve
Offset Curve can do inset or outset lines, with sharp or round corners

Configuration Details

Speed and Power
The two main controls for the laser are the speed and the power
Speed is measured in mm/second
Power is a percentage - below ~12%, the laser will not work
Slower speed, with the same power, will cut deeper
More power, with the same speed, will cut deeper
Use one of the example pieces next to the laser cutters to pick an appropriate speed/power pair for your material and desired result
“Quality” degrades at higher speeds
“Ringing” or wobbly lines when the laser needs to change direction
Multiple shallow passes can be better than very low speeds with very high power

Engrave
Closed shapes can be engraved
Make sure the lines are united!
Engraving alternates between multiple shapes on the same layer
Scan gap sets the distance between horizontal passes
Engrave lines are always horizontal
Multiple shapes on a single layer
Large scan gap

GradeEngrave
GradeEngrave “fades” the edges of an engraved area

Layer Ordering
The order of each layer in the layer list is important
The list is cut from top to bottom
Make sure you cut your outline last, or the half-finished part may fall through the bed!
Ordering between overlapping cuts and engraves can give subtle differences
Very shallow cuts done before deep engraves may be completely engraved away
Cuts done after engraves will always leave a mark
For a single colour, the software will try to cut from inner to outer, which is generally the right thing
Use the simulation tool to confirm
You can always add another layer to force ordering


The marked area in LaserCut represents the bed, but the machine has no fixed reference points, so absolute positioning is difficult/impossible
Instead, we use a relative positioning mode: “Immediate” mode
The “blue dot” in LaserCut is the starting position.
When you press start, the machine will work relative to that starting position
The position of the blue dot within the black rectangle is irrelevant
All that matters is the position of your design relative to the blue dot
The blue dot can be moved with “Set knife origin”
Check that “Immediate” is ticked in the software!
