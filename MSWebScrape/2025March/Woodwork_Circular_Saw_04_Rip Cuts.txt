Circular Saw
Training 4: Rip Cuts

Rip Cuts
The  next cut we will practice in training is a rip cut*
These differ from crosscuts in 2 main ways:
Larger workpieces, different work holding requirements
Possible to use guides to increase accuracy

* similarly the word ‘rip cut’ means along the wood grain, so does not actually apply to cutting engineered wood such as MDF or plywood. In this context, ‘rip cut’ is taken as any cut going a long distance down the length of material, as opposed to shortways across.

Workpiece Preparation
Most cuts in makespace can be handled by positioning the saw over the workbench split, as discussed previously
Again, short pieces may be overhung from a workbench
If for some reason you cannot use the benches, then it is best to lay out the cut on the floor. Place two sacrificial strips of wood (e.g. 2x3 studding) going across the cut line to ensure the saw does not touch the floor (see image)

Guide Rail
It is perfectly safe and possible to make rip cuts freehand with a circular saw
However even with experience it is difficult to maintain a straight cut over the long distance
Fortunately, makespace has a dedicated guide rail which can be used to help
To use the rail, first fit the carriage into the fence slot of the saw, then tighten the screw as shown

Guide Rail (Continued)
Next, lay the rail on the surface and place the saw and carriage onto the track
Move the rail about until the blade lines up with the pencil mark over the whole length (To make sure you can use a ‘dry run’ - with power off and the cutting depth raised higher than the wood, push the saw back and forth along the rail and check that the blade aligns correctly over the whole length)
Use the dedicated clamps to lock the rail in place 

The Cut
Whether using a guide rail or not, the process of taking the cut is the same as with the crosscut
Consider your body position - will you be able to reach the saw comfortably at all stages of the cutting process?
With long cuts the answer is often no, so you will need to:
Switch of the saw whilst it is still in the cut, holding it securely while it comes to rest
Let go of the saw and move your body position
Pull the saw back slightly so it is not starting up in contact with the wood
Turn it back on and when it has come up to speed, resume cutting
