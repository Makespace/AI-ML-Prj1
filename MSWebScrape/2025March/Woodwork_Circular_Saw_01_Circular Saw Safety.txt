Equipment Safety

Personal Protection
Goggles are required.
Non safety glasses are usually made from brittle material and may not protect you from flying shrapnel.
Other people working in the workshop space should also have eye protection and hearing protection if you are using this equipment.
Dust is hazardous so wear a face mask, if cutting MDF or other especially toxic woods
Hearing protection is required.
Remove dangling clothing and jewellery. Tie back long hair



Inspect the saw
Ensure the saw is not plugged in
Firstly inspect the power cable for cuts, nicks, kinks or frayed ends.
Move on to checking the main plastic housing for any cracks, loose screws etc
Next check that the blade guard moves freely and returns home properly
Check the blade has all its teeth, is clean, properly secured and rotates freely
Ensure the riving knife is in place and is straight
If there are any problems do not use the saw and inform the owners
Riving knife
Blade guard

Kickback
This is where the wood pinches the blade, throwing the saw backwards violently towards the operator
To avoid kick back:
Cut in a straight line. Use a guide or rip fence if possible
Ensure the workpiece and the waste are properly secured so they do not pinch the blade
Do not cut wet, green wood, knotty or very resinous materials
Do not remove or pull back the saw from a semi-finished cut until the blade has stopped rotating
Do not stand with your body in line with the cut
Do not put the saw down until the blade has stopped spinning
Ensure the blade depth and angle adjustments are secure


DO NOT
Clamp or mount the saw in any way to try to make a stationary saw

Clamp or fix the blade guard in a retracted position

Plug in the saw in until your ready to make a cut. Unplug it immediately after cutting
