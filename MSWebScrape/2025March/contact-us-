Telephone
You can call the space on 01223 324379.
Note that Makespace has no full-time staff. If you do phone and someone answers, it could be any of our several hundred members.
Important information
Please note that there is no parking on site.
The car park in front of the space has a barrier and all the spaces are reserved for other organisation. You will not be able to use it.
There are bike racks in front of the building as well as in the back. The back access is closed to the public in the evening and during the weekends, and therefore offers a safer storage place for your bike.
If you are coming from the outside of the city, the best places to park are along the backs in Queen’s road or in the nearby streets. The Grand Arcade also has a parking.
