Easy-Wood Tools Basics

Dull Cutters
The tools will become dull (blunt) over time. This will:
Increase tearout and produce a rougher surface finish
Increase dust production
Increase risk of catches (tool sticking in workpiece, causing damage)
Cause excessive heating of the tool (although some heating is normal even with a sharp tool)
Note the above symptoms can also be caused by cutting too heavily. If the cutter doesn’t cut well with light cuts, it’s probably blunt.


When to Rotate or Replace Cutter
Poor cutting performance is often a symptom of a blunt tool
Gross defects in the cutter can be seen by eye, e.g. chips in the blade
Sharpness of the blade can be checked (gently!) with your finger
The best time to change the cutting edge is just before your final cut, to give the best finish before sanding.  

Sharpening
When the cutter performance has degraded:
Easy Woodturning Tips 4: How to change or rotate your cutters
