The 3D printers at makespace can be used to create objects out of various plastics.
They use so called Additive Manufacturing, building up the object layer by layer.


3D printing can be used to prototype, create replacement parts, and is even versatile enough to print prostheses and medical prototypes.  It will have a growing impact on our world, as more and more people gain access to these amazing machines.

What this training will offer
Purpose: allow you to use the 3D printers safely
Scope: Limitations, thermoplastics, basic workflow, safe use
Excluded: Resin printer, vacuum former, other machines
Learning objectives: You understand the available 3D printing facilities at Makespace

This won’t teach you everything about 3D printing. It is a vast field and fun to explore. The internet offers lots of resources. There will be links to recommended videos at the end.

Makespace 3D-Printers
FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling)
Pushes plastic filament through a heated nozzle
Deposits one layer of material at a time, slowly growing the objectNozzle moves in a plane with the build plate going down with each layer
You can print various thermoplastics including PLA, ABS and TPU with them
5

3D printing workflow
CADDesign your own parts
Download existing model
E.g. printables / thingiverse / thangs / makerworld
STL/3MF File
Thin shell representation of part i.e. no internal material
Slice with “slicer” program
Decide how to turn model into layers and instructions for printer
gcode File
Instructions for printer e.g. move motor, heat nozzle
Execute with printer

Strong
Weak
Limitations
Can’t print in thin air
Orientation and design of parts matters
Software can generate supports
Bridges up to ca. 20mm, 45° overhangs OK
Layers stronger than layer adhesion
Orientation and design matters
Split print and assemble to optimize
Limited Accuracy
Shrinkage dependant on material distribution
Material Properties
Sensitive to heat, chemicals, UV
Not food safe
Examples of FDM stress tests

PLA (Polylactic Acid)
Derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane
“Biodegradable” 
(in industrial composting facilities)
Heat-resistant up to 60°
Stiff yet with lower tensile strength than ABS
Available in a variety of finishes: glossy, matte, dual-tone, and thermochromic
Emissions during printing are not conclusively harmful
PLA vs ABS
ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
Exhibits high durability and strength, suited for technical applications
Requires high print temperatures for optimal interlayer bonding
More prone to warping compared to PLA due to higher shrinkage
Heat-resistant up to 80°-100°C
Can be smoothed with acetone vapors for a polished finish
Limited color options available
Emits toxic fumes during printing; ventilation needed
8

TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
A flexible and elastic material, returning to its shape after bending
Good abrasion resistance, suitable for objects requiring movement
Prints at similar temperatures to PLA
Resistant to oils, greases, and various solvents
Can be more challenging to print due to its flexibility
Fewer color options than PLA but generally more than ABS

Health and Safety
Slide 12 of 11

Hazards
Nozzle is a burn hazard (over 200°)
Build plate is a burn hazard(100° for ABS, 60° for PLA)
Machine moves autonomously and unexpectedly (pinch hazard)
Filaments (in particular ABS) create fumes when printed

No PPE is required to operate the printers.

Safe Operation of Equipment
Slide 14 of 11

Specific do’s and don’ts
Don’t stick your hand in machine while it is running
Don’t move printhead by hand when machine is on
Don’t try to move the printbed
Don’t use metal brush to clean nozzles
Don’t use metal scraper to remove prints from print plate

If in doubt: switch off the printer
The only thing you will lose/damage is your print.
