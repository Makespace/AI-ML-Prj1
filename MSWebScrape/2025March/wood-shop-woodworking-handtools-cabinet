Risk Assessment
Step 1: study the equipment training material
Introduction
Woodworking hand tools can be used for marking, measuring, cutting, carving or planing/flatenning solid timber. 
These traditional tools have for the most part been used for woodworking for centuries before power tools became popular in the mid 20th century
They can be used on their own or in combination with power tools 
You should consider using them when:
you want the joy of producing something completely by hand;
you want lower levels of noise, dust and risk to yourself and others;
a cut cannot be made safely using a power tool/machinery;
flattening boards before passing them through the thicknesser;
When cutting/finessing joinery;
In may other situationsâ€¦too many to cover on this course 
What can you make using the hand tools?
