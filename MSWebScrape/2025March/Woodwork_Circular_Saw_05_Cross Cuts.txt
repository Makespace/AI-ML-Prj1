Circular Saw
Training 3: Crosscuts

Crosscuts
The first cut we will practice in training is a crosscut*


* technically the word ‘crosscut’ means across the wood grain, so does not actually apply to cutting engineered wood such as MDF or plywood. In this context, ‘crosscut’ is taken as any cut going across a strip of material, as opposed to down its length

Step 1: Workpiece Preparation
Position the workpiece over two continuous, sturdy supports
At makespace, we recommend positioning the workbenches with a slight gap between, hovering the cut line over this gap
Clamp the longer end of the workpiece securely to the bench (the other end must be left ‘free’
Alternatively if you are cutting a very short length, just hang the cut end out over the side of the bench so it will fall straight to the floor when cut

Step 2 - The Cut
Plug in the saw
Adopt a comfortable stance and position the front of the saw on the workpiece with the blade guard not yet touching the workpiece
Line up the notch on the front of the saw plate with the marked out line
Pull the 2-stage trigger and let the saw come up to speed
Slowly and gently push the saw forward and begin the cut
If you see the front of the saw wander away from the notch, gently steer the saw in the opposite direction as it moves forward
Hold initial enable switch first
Then squeeze main trigger to turn on

Step 3 - Finishing
Once you have cut all the way through, the cut piece will fall away
The blade guard will automatically spring shut
Let the blade come to a halt before lifting up
One the guard is back in place, place the saw on the workbench and inspect your work
