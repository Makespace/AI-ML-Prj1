Chisel Sharpening
Matt uses Waterstones rather than diamond stones but the general principles of establishing a primary bevel and then refining a secondary bevel on the stones still apply 
Plane blade sharpening
Paul does everything by hand but the principles are always the same. Alternatively see the following link for a Tormek and stones approach https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtCAbP_B4as&t=21s
Please keep in mind that all the trainers at Makespace are volunteers. They, like all Makespace members, give their time to continually improve our community. Do not hesitate to ask for training, or indeed any questions, but please be patient as they make time in their schedules to run the practical assessments.
