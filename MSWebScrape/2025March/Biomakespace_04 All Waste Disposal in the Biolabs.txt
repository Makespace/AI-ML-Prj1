Where to find the bins and bin liners
The bio-bins are located on the benches in the main biolab and the tissue culture (middle lab). 

Stock of new (unused) bio-bins can be found on the low shelf to right of door in middle lab or to left of autoclave

General waste black bin liners and autoclave bags can be found in the cupboard under the sink in both main lab and tissue culture (middle lab)

Biological and clinical waste needs to be sterilised before disposal. An autoclave is used for this purpose.

We have a Boxer 200/40LR benchtop autoclave. This has a capacity of 40 litres, has a round chamber and is front loading. It is located in a wheeled trolley in the Tissue Culture Lab (Room 101).

Please see our Autoclave training (online) to learn how to use our autoclave safely and effectively. This content will be covered in your in-person safety assessment.
Biowaste disposal: autoclave

After autoclaving, biobins and autoclave bags containing the autoclaved material need to be put into a black bag, then in a yellow clinical waste bag. 
Then dispose of this yellow bag in a yellow container in the bin store outside the back of the labs.

Black bags are located in the cupboard under the sink in both biolabs. New Yellow clinical waste bags are in the middle lab in the cupboard under the sink

To access the bin store:
Leave via the Clifford Allbutt Building basement exit.
Go through the double doors by prototype/Maker Lab.
Turn right twice and go out, cross the carpark.
The store door is on the left. Your BioMakespace card gives you access.
Biowaste disposal - autoclave

Disposal of polystyrene/styrofoam  boxes:
Bioreagents need to be shipped cold- on ice (4 degrees) or frozen: dry -ice (-80 degrees). They arrive in polystyrene boxes. 
The cardboard box needs to be flattened and goes into recycling 
The dry ice can be left to evaporate in a closed (not sealed) polystyrene box NOTE: Do not leave dry ice in an unventilated room to evaporate. It will release a build-up of carbon dioxide into the air that can cause rapid suffocation


Once the dry ice has been evaporated, bring the box to the bin store - same place as the autoclaved biological waste
