Mitre Saw
Introduction

What is a mitre saw?
A power mitre saw, also known as a chop saw or drop saw, is used to make a quick, accurate crosscut in a workpiece. Cuts can be made at various angles by changing the angle of the blade relative to the fence.
Our saw is a sliding compound mitre, which allows for rotation of the blade angle along two axes.
Common uses include framing and the cutting of molding. 




What can you make using a mitre saw?

What can you cut using a mitre saw?

Depending on the blade installed, you can use a mitre saw to cut various materials at various angles.
Wood
Mild steel
Non-ferrous metals
Plastic




What to cut with a mitre saw
Best tool for efficiently making repetitive chops/cuts.
Cross cuts through timber or relatively narrow workpieces. Sliding rails extend cutting length, but maximum cut length on makespace mitre saw is 80mm (3.1”) by 320mm (12.5”). 
Less precise cuts than bandsaw. Blade & kerf are wider than band saw.
Suitable for wood, mdf, plywood, non-ferrous metals, plastics.



What other saws can be used instead?
Scroll saw (small pieces, better for curves but slower, less throat height)
Band  saw (better for precise cuts, making veneers, cutting curves, ripping longer lengths of wood
Jigsaw for complex shapes
Circular saw for long, straight cuts

Curves
Very wide workpieces. The chop saw will not be able to fully cut through materials more than 320mm (12.5”) wide. (If you are careful in aligning, you can flip the material to complete the cut.)
Very thick workpieces. The maximum blade depth is 80mm (3.1”).
