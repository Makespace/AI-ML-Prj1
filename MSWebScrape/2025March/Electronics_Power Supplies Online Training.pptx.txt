Power Supplies
Online Training

Scope
These online materials are designed to get you ready to operate the Makespace power supplies and familarise yourself with the basic operating procedure.
No prior knowledge of how to use the power supplies are assumed.
If you already know how to use a power supply, this material has been designed to get you up to speed use of the Makespace units quickly. 
This guide covers what all power supply users need to know in Makespace. For those who need it, some adhoc inperson training may be available.

What a lab power supply is used for
Safe use of the MS power supplies

Power Supply Uses
A lab power supply is used to power electrical / electrical circuits at a constant voltage or current. 
It has adjustable current / voltage controls and a readout to display the current and voltage, so you can see what is happening.

Safety Risks & Mitigation
Risks
Mitigation
Electrical Shock / Fire / Burns - Due to damaged cabling, faulty equipment, poor earthing etc.





Equipment should be visually inspected before use to check for faults including: loose / missing / damaged parts on the unit and, damaged cabling and plugs. 
Faults should be reported with the Trouble Ticket form (on the Equipment page). Dangerous faults should be reported to the group and Management and the item labelled ‘Faulty: Do not use’. 
All electrical items should be switched off after use.
Emergency stop isolation switches (on the wall) can be used to isolate the electrical power in an emergency. 

Power Supply Operation
The basic operating procedure for the TTI EL302RT power supply is covered on the next slides. The other power supplies are operated in a similar manner but there are some variations in operation which have been highlighted. 
It is advisable to disable the power supply output and set the current & voltage limits before connecting the load to reduce the risk of damaging parts. 

First, visually inspect the unit and cabling to check for faults before switching on. 
Connect the load to be powered using test leads to the output. 
Disable the output (enable buttons). 
Depress the power switch on the front left hand side of the unit to power on.

Set the voltage limit using the course and fine controls (30 V, 2 A max). 
Set the current limit using the current limit control. 
Enable the output by depressing the enable switch. 
The display will show the measured current and voltage and LEDs will indicate if the constant current limit has been reached.

Disable the output (push button on lower right).
Connect the load to the aux output. 
Display the voltage by pressing the push switch (bottom right of the output terminals). 
Set the voltage (1.5 V - 5 V) using the voltage level control (top right of the output terminals). 
Enable the output.
