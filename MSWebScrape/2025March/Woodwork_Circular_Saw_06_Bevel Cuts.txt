Circular Saw
Training 5: Bevel Cuts

Bevel Cuts
The final cut you will cover in training is a bevel cut
In a circular saw context this is a cut made with the saw set at an angle to its own base plate, 
This is different to a mitre, which is where the saw is simply pushed along a pencil line at a non-90° angle to the workpiece
Note that tilting the bed of the band saw is usually a more accurate and safer method of producing a bevel.

Setting the Bevel Angle
To set a bevel angle, release the bevel setting screw and pivot the base plate to the desired angle
The built-in scale is a good indicator of the set angle, but if it’s really important check yourself with a protractor for accuracy
Once happy, tighten the screw to lock the angle
Note - when finished with the saw always return to 90° for the next user

The Cut
The actual process of cutting on the bevel is no different to a regular rip or crosscut
The regular alignment notch at the front of the saw will no longer work. An alternative notch is provided for 45° bevels, but for other angles you will have to rely only on sighting the blade
Bevel cuts also tend to ‘show up’ small mistakes caused by a wandering blade compared to regular cuts, so use of the guide rail is highly recommended
