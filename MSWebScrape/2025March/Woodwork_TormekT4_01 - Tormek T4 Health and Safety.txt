Health and Safety

Loose Articles of Clothing
The Tormek T4 makes use of a constantly rotating grindstone, as such the following items should NOT be worn when operating the Tormek to avoid trapping and/or catching.
Ties and scarves
Bracelets, necklaces and rings
Long sleeves
Gloves
Wired Headphones
Long Hair should also be tied up where possible.

Use of Water
The Tormek uses a Water Trough to keep the grindstone and tools cool, this introduces some Health and Safety issues.
Spillages may result in wet surfaces, leading to slips and falls, clean up any spilt water with a paper towel.
A large amount of the equipment is electrical, ensure that the Tormek is not being used near any source of electricity to avoid shocks in the event of a spillage.
The Grind Stone MUST be used with water, it should not be used dry, this will ensure correct sharpening of your tools and prevents damage to the stone.

Sharp Objects
The Tormek is designed to sharpen tools, eventually your tools will be sharpened to a level that you deem fit for use.
Gloves cannot be worn when using the Tormek to avoid catching and trapping your fingers, avoid cuts and scratches by carefully handling your tools once sharpened.
When freehand grinding, grind away from the blade edge. Grinding towards the blade edge is more difficult to control and can result in slipping, damaging the stone and potentially yourself too.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
The tormek is a very safe piece of equipment to use in general. The gentle sharpening of your tools will not produce any heat or sparks, and the stone itself can be touched whilst in motion without fear of hurting yourself.
No special PPE, in addition to safety glasses, is required to be worn whilst using the Tormek.  
Safety glasses should always be worn when working in the secure workshop
