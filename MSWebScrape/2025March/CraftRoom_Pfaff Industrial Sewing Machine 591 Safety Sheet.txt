Checks Before First Use
Check the oil level, alert an owner if low.
Checks Before Each Operation
Check there nothing other than the material you want to sew under the needle and roller foot.

When Operating This Equipment:
Sew carefully as the needle has no finger guard. Do NOT put your finger too close to the needle when sewing.

Use heavy duty sewing such as denim and thin-medium thickness leather. 

Works best with thicker thread, such as the Gutermann ‘Extra strong’ polyester thread.
 
Can only sew a straight forward stitch (no zig zag or back stitching) of lengths 0 -5mm.

As it is currently set up, the Pfaff machine will not work well with thin thread or light fabrics, as used in standard dressmaking. Please use the Janome sewing machine for this.

This training deck contains covers the basics of using the machine. 
Sharp needles.
RED EQUIPMENT: Not to be used without completing online training and practical assessment.
